    <p>Does the performance of the language with regards to speed actually correlate with its popularity?</p>

    <img class="single-img" src="images\popularity.png" alt= "popularity-chart">

    <p>As you can see, the speed with which a lanaguage can perform tasks does not actually closely match with how frequently it is used.  As surprising as this may seem, consider this, "Is going fast actually that important?"  Of course you need to have some decent level of speed, but for the most part, most tasks can be done in pretty much every computing language in the blink of an eye.  Unless you're working on some military level mission critical system, or doing some quant trading online with highly competitive bots, there's not really any point to sacrificing the ease with which you can code for a few milliseconds in performance.</p>
